This application has been developed to meet all those activities that require the constant use of different credentials and updating of the same, as in the smart-working. Rather than writing your credentials in a disorganized way, it allows you to have an easily updated and organized DB that you can also comment on (if you want to keep a note in mind).
The two buttons on the main screen allow you to directly copy the contents of Username and Password, to easily paste these data into the interface you want, without showing them the plain text (excellent system if you are in a call and you cannot hide the window).<br>
<br>
I hope it will be useful to you.<br>
